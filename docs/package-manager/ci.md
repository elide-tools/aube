# CI and containers

Commit the project's lockfile and build approvals before adding aube to CI.
A frozen install fails when the manifest and lockfile disagree, making the
failure visible instead of updating dependency versions during a build.

## Choose an install command

| Command | Existing `node_modules` | Lockfile behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `aube ci` | Removed before installation | Requires a fresh committed lockfile |
| `aube install --frozen-lockfile` | Can reuse the current install | Requires a fresh committed lockfile |
| `aube install --prod --frozen-lockfile` | Installs production dependencies | Requires a fresh committed lockfile |

Use `aube ci` for a clean build. Use `--frozen-lockfile` when retaining an
existing install is useful. Set the flag explicitly in scripts so the intent
is clear outside CI too.

## GitHub Actions

The [aube setup action](https://github.com/jdx/aube-action) installs the native
binary and can install Node.js in the same step:

```yaml
name: Test
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
      - uses: jdx/aube-action@v1
        with:
          node-version: "24"
      - run: aube ci
      - run: aube run --no-install test
```

Use the Node version required by your project. The final command skips the
auto-install check because the preceding step already installed dependencies.
See the action's README for version pins, inputs, and outputs.

## Dependency builds

CI cannot make an interactive build-approval decision. Review required scripts
locally with `aube ignored-builds` and `aube approve-builds`, then commit the
resulting workspace YAML. `strictDepBuilds: true` makes unreviewed dependency
builds fail installation instead of being skipped.

For stricter policy, see the [security settings](/security#the-paranoid-switch).
If you enable jailed builds, check the runner's
[platform requirements](/package-manager/jailed-builds#native-enforcement).

## Cache choices

`aube store path` prints the resolved content store, including its `v1/`
directory. Registry metadata lives separately under the configured cache
directory. `aube doctor` shows the resolved paths.

The [global virtual store](/package-manager/global-virtual-store) is disabled
in CI by default, so `node_modules` holds real package files and can be cached
like any other directory. A frozen lockfile still controls which versions are
installed. A cache is an optimization, not a replacement for the committed
lockfile or build policy.

To reuse installs across jobs, cache `node_modules` and run
`aube install --frozen-lockfile`. A restored job reports "Already up to date"
without downloading or linking anything. Don't pair the cache with `aube ci`:
it deletes `node_modules` before installing, so the restored cache is thrown
away.

The [aube setup action](https://github.com/jdx/aube-action) does this with
`cache: true`:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v7
  - uses: jdx/aube-action@v1
    with:
      node-version: "24"
      run-install: true
      cache: true
  - run: aube run --no-install test
```

With `cache: true`, `run-install` installs with
`aube install --frozen-lockfile` instead of `aube ci` and saves `node_modules`
right after an install that missed the cache. The key covers the runner OS and
architecture, the Node.js and aube versions, the checkout path, every lockfile,
`package.json`, and workspace or `.npmrc` configuration under
`working-directory`, and the `install-args` input. In a workspace, list each
package's `node_modules` in `cache-path`:

```yaml
- uses: jdx/aube-action@v1
  with:
    node-version: "24"
    run-install: true
    cache: true
    cache-path: |
      node_modules
      packages/*/node_modules
```

### Caching without the action input

To manage the cache yourself, for example with a different install step, use
`actions/cache` directly:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v7
  - uses: jdx/aube-action@v1
    id: aube
    with:
      node-version: "24"
  - uses: actions/cache@v6
    with:
      path: node_modules
      key: aube-nm-${{ runner.os }}-${{ runner.arch }}-node${{ steps.aube.outputs.node-version }}-${{ hashFiles('**/aube-lock.yaml') }}
  - run: aube install --frozen-lockfile
  - run: aube run --no-install test
```

Include the Node.js version and runner architecture in the key. Dependency
builds approved in `allowBuilds` can compile native addons for one Node.js ABI,
and aube does not reinstall a restored `node_modules` when only the Node.js
version changes. Don't add a `restore-keys` fallback for this cache: a partial
match would be treated as the installed state. In a workspace, add each
package's `node_modules` directory to `path`; the `**/aube-lock.yaml` pattern
already covers member lockfiles when workspace packages keep their own. aube
keeps an existing [lockfile format](/package-manager/lockfiles), so if the
project uses `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `bun.lock`, `yarn.lock`, or an npm lockfile,
hash that file instead. If the repository also contains unrelated lockfiles,
such as test fixtures, list only the project's lockfiles in `hashFiles` so
changes to them don't invalidate the cache.

Restore the cache at the same checkout path it was saved from. Windows
junctions and transitive `link:` dependencies store absolute paths, so a tree
restored under a different directory can report "Already up to date" while
those links point at the old location. GitHub-hosted runners check out to the
same path for a repository on each OS; if a job changes it (for example with
`actions/checkout`'s `path` input), include that path in the key.

## Container builds

Install aube in the image using one of the [installation methods](/installation),
then copy dependency inputs before application source when arranging cacheable
layers. Include the lockfile, `package.json`, workspace manifests, patches, and
configuration that affect resolution.

```sh
# Build stage: include development tools.
aube install --frozen-lockfile
aube run --no-install build

# Runtime stage: install only runtime dependencies.
aube install --prod --frozen-lockfile
```

Run the commands in their respective stages; they are not a complete Dockerfile.
Root lifecycle scripts may require source files during installation. Copy those
files before the install, or explicitly defer scripts if the project supports it.

For a workspace package, [deploy](/cli/deploy) can prepare a target directory
with publishable files and installed dependencies:

```sh
aube --filter @acme/api deploy dist/api
```

## When CI rejects the lockfile

Reproduce the failure locally with `aube install --frozen-lockfile`. If the
manifest change was intentional, run `aube install`, review the resulting diff,
and commit the updated lockfile. See [troubleshooting](/troubleshooting#the-lockfile-is-out-of-sync)
for repair options.
